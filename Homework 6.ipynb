    "\n",
    "Suppose you are in charge of a magical baked goods machine that creates delicious baked goods of many varieties. Every day, the machine creates batches of 5 different baked goods. To produce a batch of a baked good, you must first clean the machine to remove the remnants of the previous batch of bakery treats (e.g., the workflow could be, \"clean, make bread, clean, make donuts,...\"). The durations of baking each of the 5 items (donuts, bread, cookies, scones, and coffee cake) are 40, 32, 50, 28, and 47 minutes respectively. The cleaning times depend on the item that was previously made in the machine. For example, a long cleaning period is required if bread is made after scones, since the scones leave a sticky residue from the dried fruit they contain that can ruin the bread. The times are given in minutes in the following table. Each pair $(i,j)$ is the cleaning time required if batch $j$ is baked after batch $i$.\n",
